# C.U.R.I.E
A prototype Desktop Helper A.I that enchanches a more humane approach interaction between machine and human.

Central Unit of Robotics Intelligence and Experiments (or C.U.R.I.E for short) is the grand core project from the 12 month Personal Engineering Challenge. Meaning that as the months continue this project recives bits of updates that spark from the other projects. C.U.R.I.E is able to distinguish the user's voice and control the computer in which it is hosted.

Version 1.0: Included Voice Regocnition, Opening certain apps and webpages, as well as writting and sending mail. (January 16 2021)

Version 2.0: Aditional Software Updates including: Google maps automatization navigation control, Instagram control via voice, and User Interface. (July 31 2021)

(Since this is a grand project it has been continued after the conclusion of the 12 month Personal Engineering Challenge)

Version 3.0: Additional Software Update: Spotify Automatic navigation control. (January 31 2022)

Version 4.0: Additional Software Updates: Integration of Neural Network for automatic song play & inclusion of a new Spotify voice control (June 31 2022)

Part of the 12 months Personal Engineering Challenges created by this user himself. The 12 months Personal Engineering Challenge was a challenge in which the user created each month a different project to tackle an Engineering Challenge. Later Using Social Media a demo of the concluded project was published. A project had to be started and finished in a span of 1 month otherwise it wouldn't count.

This challenge was made in order to spread STEM across Social Media, during the COVID lockdown.
