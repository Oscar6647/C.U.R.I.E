Central Unit of Robotics Intelligence and Experiments (or C.U.R.I.E for short) is the grand core project from the 12 month Personal Engineering Challenge. Meaning that as the months continue this project recives bits of updates that spark from the other projects. C.U.R.I.E is able to distinguish the user's voice and control the computer in which it is hosted.

Part of the 12 months Personal Engineering Challenges created by this user himself. The 12 months Personal Engineering Challenge was a challenge in which the user created each month a different project to tackle an Engineering Challenge. Later Using Social Media a demo of the concluded project was published. A project had to be started and finished in a span of 1 month otherwise it wouldn't count.

This challenge was made in order to spread STEM across Social Media, during the COVID lockdown.
